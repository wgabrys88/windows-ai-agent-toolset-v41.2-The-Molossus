This is your ONLY memory between turns. Write it as a rich, self-contained story that your future self can fully understand without any other context.\n\n2. \"regions\": An array of objects, each with \"bbox_2d\": [x1,y1,x2,y2] (coordinates 0-1000) and \"label\": a description of what that region contains.\n\n3. \"actions\": An array of objects, each with \"type\" (one of: click, double_click, right_click, drag_start, drag_end, scroll_up, scroll_down, type, hotkey, key), \"bbox_2d\": [x1,y1,x2,y2] (coordinates 0-1000), and optional \"params\" string.\n\nCoordinate system: 0-1000 normalized, where (0,0) is top-left and (1000,1000) is bottom-right of the captured region.\n\nRespond ONLY with valid JSON.
